## Navigation Structure

### Desktop Navigation (Top Bar)

- Home

- For Businesses
- Pricing
- About
- Contact

**Authenticated Section** (When signed in):
- Consumer Dashboard
- Business Dashboard
- Business Settings

**Admin Section** (When user has admin role):

### Mobile Navigation (Hamburger Menu)
All the same items as desktop, organized in collapsible sections.

## Admin Role Detection

The navigation checks for admin status using:
```typescript
const isAdmin = user?.publicMetadata?.role === "admin"
```

To set a user as admin, update their publicMetadata in Clerk:
```json
{
  "role": "admin"
}
```

## Components Created

### 1. Confirmation Dialog (`/src/components/ui/confirm-dialog.tsx`)
Reusable confirmation dialog for destructive actions:

**Props:**
- `open: boolean` - Controls dialog visibility
- `onClose: () => void` - Called when dialog closes
- `onConfirm: () => void` - Called when user confirms action
- `title: string` - Dialog title
- `description: string` - Dialog description text
- `isDestructive?: boolean` - If true, shows red destructive styling
- `confirmText?: string` - Confirm button text (default: "Continue")
- `cancelText?: string` - Cancel button text (default: "Cancel")

**Example Usage:**
```tsx
import { ConfirmDialog } from "@/components/ui/confirm-dialog"

function MyComponent() {
  const [showConfirm, setShowConfirm] = useState(false)

  const handleDelete = () => {
    // Perform deletion
    console.log("Deleted!")
  }

  return (
    <>
      <Button onClick={() => setShowConfirm(true)}>
        Delete Item
      </Button>

      <ConfirmDialog
        open={showConfirm}
        onClose={() => setShowConfirm(false)}
        onConfirm={handleDelete}
        title="Delete this item?"
        description="This action cannot be undone. This will permanently delete the item from our servers."
        isDestructive={true}
        confirmText="Delete"
        cancelText="Cancel"
      />
    </>
  )
}
```
