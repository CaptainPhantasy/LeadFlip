# AI-Powered Conversational Interview - Implementation Guide

## 🚀 **What We Built**

An intelligent, conversational AI interview system that transforms the consumer experience from a boring form into a **friendly, intelligent conversation** that extracts comprehensive service request details.

### **The Transformation:**

**Before (Static Form):**
```
Consumer: "My water heater is broken"
System: ✅ Submitted
```

**After (AI Interview):**
```
Consumer: "My water heater is broken"

AI: <thinking>
They mentioned "water heater broken" but I need to know:
- Is this an emergency (flooding) or standard (no hot water)?
- Age of unit (affects repair vs replace recommendation)
- Location of leak if any
- Budget expectations
Most urgent: Assess if this is active flooding
</thinking>

"That sounds frustrating! Let me help you get this sorted out quickly.
Can you tell me - is there any water actively leaking right now,
or is it just that you don't have hot water?"

Consumer: "Yeah it's leaking from the bottom, making a puddle"

AI: <thinking>
Bottom leak = likely tank failure, not repairable
Puddle = not emergency flooding yet, but will get worse
Need: age of unit, location/ZIP, budget range
</thinking>

"Okay, a bottom tank leak usually means the unit needs replacement
rather than repair. How old is your water heater? And what's your
ZIP code so I can match you with local pros?"

Consumer: "It's about 10 years old, I'm in Carmel 46032. How much does replacement cost?"

AI: "For a 10-year-old unit in Carmel, you're looking at roughly
$1,200-$2,500 for a standard 40-50 gallon replacement, installed.
What's your budget range for this?"

[Continues until complete]

Final Extraction:
✅ Service: Plumbing (water heater replacement)
✅ Urgency: Urgent (active leak, not flooding)
✅ Location: Carmel, IN 46032
✅ Budget: $1,200-$2,500
✅ Details: 10yr old unit, bottom tank leak, needs replacement
✅ Quality Score: 9.5/10
```

## 🧠 **Core Features**

### **1. Extended Thinking Mode**
- Claude uses `<thinking>` blocks to reason about what info is needed
- Thinks from a **service provider's perspective** (20+ years experience)
- Visible to user for transparency ("Here's what I'm considering...")
- Streaming in real-time as Claude reasons

### **2. Service Provider Chain-of-Thought (COT)**
System prompt makes Claude think like an expert intake specialist:
- *"What details would a technician need to quote this accurately?"*
- *"Is their stated urgency realistic based on symptoms?"*
- *"Is their budget expectation realistic for this work?"*
- *"What critical info am I still missing?"*

### **3. Intelligent Question Sequencing**
- **ONE question at a time** (doesn't overwhelm)
- **Context-aware follow-ups** (adapts based on previous answers)
- **Gentle probing** ("You said ASAP - is there active water damage?")
- **Budget normalization** ("No wrong answer, just helps match you with the right pros")

### **4. Real-Time Extraction**
As the conversation progresses, structured data is extracted live:
```typescript
{
  service_category: "plumbing",
  problem_description: "10-year-old water heater with bottom tank leak...",
  urgency: "urgent",
  location_zip: "46032",
  budget_max: 2500,
  quality_score: 9.5
}
```

### **5. Completion Detection**
Agent automatically knows when it has enough info:
- Service category identified
- Problem description is actionable
- Location for matching
- Urgency assessed realistically
- Budget expectations set

Shows "Ready to submit!" when complete.

## 📁 **Files Created**

### **Backend:**

#### **1. Problem Interview Agent** (`src/lib/agents/problem-interview-agent.ts`)
- **Purpose:** Core AI agent for conducting interviews
- **Model:** `claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929` with extended thinking
- **Key Methods:**
  - `startInterview()` - Initialize new session
  - `processMessageStream()` - Stream responses in real-time
  - `processMessage()` - Non-streaming fallback
  - `extractInfoFromConversation()` - Extract structured data
  - `assessCompleteness()` - Determine if ready to submit
  - `calculateQualityScore()` - Score lead quality (0-10)

**System Prompt Highlights:**
```typescript
const SYSTEM_PROMPT = `You are an expert service provider intake specialist
with 20+ years of experience...

Your job: Extract enough info so a service provider can:
1. Assess urgency accurately (is this truly an emergency?)
2. Prepare properly (what tools/parts to bring)
3. Quote accurately (avoid surprise costs)
4. Schedule appropriately (do they need same-day service?)

Use <thinking> blocks to reason about:
- What critical info is still missing
- If stated urgency matches described symptoms
- If budget is realistic for described work
- Which follow-up question will extract the most value
`;
```

#### **2. Interview Router** (`src/server/routers/interview.ts`)
- **tRPC endpoints:**
  - `startInterview` - Begin new interview session
  - `sendMessage` - Streaming subscription (for future WebSocket support)
  - `sendMessageSync` - Non-streaming version (current implementation)
  - `getSession` - Get current interview state
  - `finalizeInterview` - Submit as lead + trigger orchestration

**Added to:** `src/server/routers/_app.ts`
```typescript
export const appRouter = createTRPCRouter({
  // ...existing routers
  interview: interviewRouter, // ✅ NEW
});
```

### **Frontend:**

#### **3. AI Interview Chat Component** (`src/components/consumer/ai-interview-chat.tsx`)
Beautiful streaming conversational UI with:
- **Real-time typing indicators**
- **Visible thinking blocks** (transparency)
- **Auto-scroll to latest message**
- **Extracted info preview panel** (live updates)
- **Completion detection** with submit button
- **Message history** with timestamps

**Layout:**

## 🎯 **User Experience Flow**

### **Step 1: Consumer lands on `/consumer`**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Get Help from Local Pros                   │
│  Chat with our AI assistant to describe...  │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│                                             │
│  AI: "Hi! I'm here to help connect you     │
│       with the right local service pro.    │
│       Can you tell me what you need help   │
│       with?"                                │
│                                             │
│  [Type your message... ] [Send]             │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### **Step 2: Consumer describes problem (vaguely)**
```
User: "My water heater is broken"
```

### **Step 3: AI asks intelligent follow-ups**
```
AI: <thinking>
    "Broken" is vague. Need to know:
    - Symptoms (no hot water? leaking? noise?)
    - Age (repair vs replace decision)
    - Urgency (emergency flooding?)

    Start with symptoms to assess urgency.
    </thinking>

    "That sounds frustrating! To help you quickly,
     can you describe what's happening - is there
     any water leaking, or is it just that you
     don't have hot water?"
```

### **Step 4: Conversation continues until complete**
AI gathers:
- ✅ Service category (plumbing)
- ✅ Problem details (10yr old, bottom leak)
- ✅ Location (Carmel 46032)
- ✅ Urgency (urgent, not emergency)
- ✅ Budget ($1200-$2500)

### **Step 5: Completion & submission**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  ✅ Ready to submit!                        │
│  I have all the information needed to       │
│  connect you with qualified professionals.  │
│                                             │
│  [Submit Service Request]                   │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### **Step 6: Lead creation & orchestration**
On submit, the interview agent:
1. Finalizes extracted info
2. Creates lead in database
3. **Triggers main orchestrator** (existing system):
   - Lead Classifier (already has structured data from interview)
   - Business Matcher (finds local pros in 46032)
   - Response Generator (personalized messages)
   - Notifications sent to matched businesses

## 🔧 **Technical Architecture**

### **Data Flow:**

```
Consumer Browser
      ↓
  tRPC Client (interview.sendMessageSync)
      ↓
  Interview Router (server/routers/interview.ts)
      ↓
  ProblemInterviewAgent (lib/agents/problem-interview-agent.ts)
      ↓
  Anthropic API (claude-sonnet-4-5 with extended thinking)
      ↓
  Streaming Response → Real-time UI updates
      ↓
  Extracted structured data → Preview panel
      ↓
  Completion detected → Submit button enabled
      ↓
  Finalize → Create lead in Supabase
      ↓
  Trigger Main Orchestrator → Match → Notify
```

### **State Management:**

**Session State (server-side):**
```typescript
interface InterviewSession {
  session_id: string;
  consumer_id: string;
  messages: ConversationMessage[];
  extracted_info: Partial<ExtractedProblemInfo>;
  is_complete: boolean;
  quality_score: number;
}
```

**Component State (client-side):**
```typescript
const [messages, setMessages] = useState<Message[]>([])
const [sessionId, setSessionId] = useState<string | null>(null)
const [extractedInfo, setExtractedInfo] = useState<any>({})
const [isComplete, setIsComplete] = useState(false)
const [isTyping, setIsTyping] = useState(false)
```

---

## 🚀 **How to Use**

### **As a Consumer:**

1. Go to `http://localhost:3002/consumer`
2. See AI greeting: *"Hi! I'm here to help..."*
3. Type your problem: *"My water heater is broken"*
4. Answer AI's follow-up questions naturally
5. Watch extracted info appear in real-time (right panel)
6. When complete, click **"Submit Service Request"**
7. Redirected to lead confirmation page

### **As a Developer:**

**Test the agent directly:**
```typescript
import { ProblemInterviewAgent } from '@/lib/agents/problem-interview-agent';

const agent = new ProblemInterviewAgent();

// Start interview
const { session_id } = await agent.startInterview('user-123');

// Send message
const response = await agent.processMessage(
  session_id,
  'My water heater is leaking'
);

console.log(response.text); // AI response
console.log(response.thinking); // Extended thinking
console.log(response.extracted_info); // Structured data
console.log(response.is_complete); // Ready to submit?
```

**Test via tRPC:**
```typescript
const result = await trpc.interview.startInterview.mutate({});
const sessionId = result.session_id;

const response = await trpc.interview.sendMessageSync.mutate({
  sessionId,
  message: 'My water heater is broken'
});

console.log(response.text);
console.log(response.extracted_info);
```

## 🎨 **UI Components**

### **Message Bubble (User)**
```tsx
<div className="bg-primary text-primary-foreground rounded-lg p-4">
  My water heater is broken
  <span className="text-xs opacity-70">2:45 PM</span>
</div>
```

### **Message Bubble (AI with Thinking)**
```tsx
<div className="bg-card border rounded-lg p-4">
  {/* Thinking Block */}
  <div className="bg-muted/50 border-l-4 border-primary/50 p-3 mb-3">
    <Brain className="h-3 w-3" />
    <span className="font-semibold">Thinking...</span>
    <p className="text-xs italic">
      Need to assess urgency - is this flooding or just no hot water?
    </p>
  </div>

  {/* AI Response */}
  <p>That sounds frustrating! Is there any water actively leaking?</p>
  <span className="text-xs opacity-70">2:45 PM</span>

    <CheckCircle2 className="text-green-500" />
    All required information collected
  </CardContent>
</Card>
```

---

## 🔮 **Future Enhancements**

### **1. True Streaming via WebSockets** (Currently using non-streaming)
```typescript
// Replace sendMessageSync with streaming subscription
const subscription = trpc.interview.sendMessage.useSubscription({
  sessionId,
  message: userInput
}, {
  onData: (chunk) => {
    if (chunk.type === 'thinking') {
      setCurrentThinking(prev => prev + chunk.content)
    }
    if (chunk.type === 'text') {
      setStreamingText(prev => prev + chunk.content)
    }
  }
});
```

### **2. Tool Use for Validation**
Add tools to the agent:
- **Geocoding:** Validate ZIP codes, get city/state
- **Budget Reality Check:** Compare stated budget with typical costs
- **Urgency Detection:** Analyze keywords for true emergencies
- **Phone Validation:** E.164 format checking

```typescript
const tools = [
  {
    name: 'geocode_zip',
    description: 'Validate and get details for a ZIP code',
    input_schema: {
      type: 'object',
      properties: {
        zip_code: { type: 'string' }
      }
    }
  }
];
```

### **3. Multi-Turn Memory**
Currently session-based, enhance with:
- **Cross-session learning:** Remember consumer preferences
- **Conversation context:** Reference earlier conversations
- **Smart defaults:** Pre-fill location if consumer has previous requests

### **4. Voice Input**
Integrate with Twilio for phone-based interviews:
- Consumer calls in instead of typing
- Same AI interview flow
- Transcription → text processing
- Response via text-to-speech

### **5. Sentiment Analysis**
Detect frustrated consumers:
```
Consumer: "This is the 3rd time it's broken!"
AI: <thinking>High frustration detected. Show empathy.</thinking>
    "I can hear how frustrating that must be. Let me make
     sure we get this fixed right this time..."
```

---

## 📊 **Quality Metrics**

The agent automatically scores lead quality (0-10):

**Quality Score Calculation:**
```typescript
function calculateQualityScore(info: ExtractedProblemInfo): number {
  let score = 0;

  // Must-haves
  if (info.service_category !== 'other') score += 2;
  if (info.problem_description.length > 50) score += 2;
  if (info.location_zip) score += 1.5;
  if (info.urgency) score += 1;
  if (info.budget_max || info.budget_min) score += 1.5;

  // Nice-to-haves
  if (info.key_requirements?.length > 0) score += 0.5;
  if (info.contact_phone) score += 0.5;
  if (info.location_city && info.location_state) score += 0.5;

  return Math.min(score, 10);
}
```

**Expected Outcomes:**
- **Form-based submission:** Avg quality score 4-6/10
- **AI Interview:** Avg quality score 8-10/10

---

## 🎓 **Best Practices**

### **System Prompt Design:**
✅ **DO:**
- Give Claude a specific role/persona ("20yr expert intake specialist")
- Provide reasoning framework (`<thinking>` blocks)
- List must-have vs nice-to-have info
- Set conversational tone guidelines
- Include example interactions

❌ **DON'T:**
- Make prompts too short/vague
- Overwhelm with too many rules
- Use jargon without context
- Forget to handle edge cases (vague answers, off-topic)

### **Conversation Flow:**
✅ **DO:**
- Ask ONE question at a time
- Build rapport before diving into details
- Validate consumer's feelings ("That sounds frustrating")
- Explain why you're asking ("Most plumbers will need to know...")
- Use plain language

❌ **DON'T:**
- Fire off multiple questions at once
- Use technical jargon
- Sound robotic
- Rush to completion
- Make assumptions

### **Error Handling:**
Always handle:
- Session not found
- API failures (Anthropic down)
- Malformed responses
- Consumer goes off-topic
- Consumer abandons mid-interview

```typescript
try {
  const response = await agent.processMessage(sessionId, message);
} catch (error) {
  // Fallback to static form
  return <ProblemSubmissionForm />
}
```
