# Navigation Update Summary

## Completed Tasks

### 1. ✅ Confirmation Dialog Component Created
**File:** `/Volumes/Storage/Development/LegacyCall/src/components/ui/confirm-dialog.tsx`

A reusable AlertDialog wrapper component for confirmation dialogs with the following features:

**Props:**
- `open: boolean` - Controls dialog visibility
- `onClose: () => void` - Called when dialog closes
- `onConfirm: () => void` - Called when user confirms action
- `title: string` - Dialog title
- `description: string` - Dialog description text
- `isDestructive?: boolean` - If true, shows red destructive styling on confirm button
- `confirmText?: string` - Confirm button text (default: "Continue")
- `cancelText?: string` - Cancel button text (default: "Cancel")

**Usage Example:**
```tsx
import { ConfirmDialog } from "@/components/ui/confirm-dialog"
import { useState } from "react"

function MyComponent() {
  const [showConfirm, setShowConfirm] = useState(false)

  return (
    <>
      <Button onClick={() => setShowConfirm(true)}>Delete</Button>

      <ConfirmDialog
        open={showConfirm}
        onClose={() => setShowConfirm(false)}
        onConfirm={() => console.log("Confirmed!")}
        title="Delete this item?"
        description="This action cannot be undone."
        isDestructive={true}
        confirmText="Delete"
        cancelText="Cancel"
      />
    </>
  )
}
```

### 2. ✅ Navigation Component Updated
**File:** `/Volumes/Storage/Development/LegacyCall/src/components/navigation.tsx`

Updated with ALL pages organized into three sections:

#### Public Navigation (Always Visible):
- `/` - Home
- `/consumer` - Post a Problem
- `/business` - For Businesses
- `/pricing` - Pricing
- `/about` - About
- `/contact` - Contact

#### Authenticated Navigation (When Signed In):
- `/consumer/dashboard` - Consumer Dashboard
- `/business` - Business Dashboard
- `/business/settings` - Business Settings *(NEW)*

#### Admin Navigation (When User Has Admin Role):

- `/admin/users` - Users *(NEW)*
- `/admin/audit` - Audit Log *(NEW)*

**Admin Role Detection:**

const isAdmin = user?.publicMetadata?.role === "admin"
```

To set a user as admin in Clerk, update their publicMetadata:
```json
{
  "role": "admin"
}
```

**Visual Styling:**
- Public links: Default gray text
- Authenticated links: Default gray text
- Admin links: Primary color (red) to indicate elevated privileges
