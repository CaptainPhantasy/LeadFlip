### Memory System Architecture

**Storage:**
- `.claude/memory.json` - Structured data (JSON)
- `.claude/MEMORY.md` - Human/AI readable (Markdown)

**Data Structures:**

```typescript
// Conversion Patterns
{
  serviceCategory: "plumbing",
  conversionRate: 0.85,
  avgJobValue: 450,
  avgQualityScore: 8.2,
  keyFactors: ["high quality leads", "emergency service"],
  lastUpdated: "2025-09-30T..."
}

// Seasonal Adjustments
{
  category: "lawn_care",
  months: [4,5,6,7,8,9], // Apr-Sep
  adjustment: +2, // Add 2 points to quality score
  reason: "Peak season for lawn care"
}

// Spam Patterns
{
  pattern: "test test test",
  matchType: "repeated_text",
  confidence: 0.95,
  action: "reject"
}

// Business Patterns
{
  businessId: "uuid",
  responseRate: 0.92,
  avgResponseHours: 1.5,
  preferredLeadTypes: ["emergency", "high_budget"]
}
```

### Memory-Driven Scoring Example

**Without Memory:**
```
Lead: "Need lawn mowing in December, Carmel 46032"
Base Quality Score: 7.0/10
```

**With Memory:**
```
Lead: "Need lawn mowing in December, Carmel 46032"
Base Quality Score: 7.0/10
Memory Adjustment: -2.0 (off-season for lawn care)
Final Score: 5.0/10 → Rejected (below threshold)
```

**Benefit:** Prevents wasted matches during off-season

### Notification Channels

**1. SMS (via Twilio):**
```
"A customer in Carmel needs emergency plumbing repair.
Budget: $800. Respond now: leadflip.com/business/leads"
```
- Immediate delivery
- High open rate (>95%)
- Character limit: 160

**2. Email (via SendGrid/Resend):**
```
Subject: 🚨 EMERGENCY: New plumbing lead in Carmel

Body: Detailed lead information...
CTA: View Lead →
```
- Rich formatting
- Attachments supported
- Lower urgency

**3. Slack (via Bot):**
```
📢 New Lead Match

- Workspace integration

## 🧠 Intelligence Features

### 1. Seasonal Learning

**Automatic Adjustments:**
- Summer (Jun-Sep): Lawn care +2 points
- Winter (Nov-Feb): Snow removal +2 points, lawn care -2 points
- Spring (Mar-May): Roofing +1 point

**Example:**
```
December lawn care lead: 7.0 - 2.0 = 5.0 (rejected)
June lawn care lead: 7.0 + 2.0 = 9.0 (high priority)
```

### 2. Spam Detection Evolution

**Week 1:**
- Manual spam flagging
- No patterns detected

**Week 4:**
- Detected: "test test test" → 95% spam probability
- Auto-reject enabled

**Week 8:**
- Detected: Phone number 555-5555 repeated 20 times
- IP blacklist activated

### 3. Business Preference Learning

**Week 1:**
- Business A responds to all leads

**Week 8:**
- Business A ignores <$200 leads (0% response)
- Business A responds to $500+ leads (95% response)
- Memory: Filter out <$200 matches for Business A

**Result:** 40% reduction in wasted notifications

### 4. Conversion Pattern Recognition

**Plumbing Category:**
- Emergency leads: 85% conversion, $450 avg
- Normal leads: 60% conversion, $300 avg
- **Action:** Prioritize emergency plumbing in matching
