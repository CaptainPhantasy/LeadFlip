## Recommended Agent Architecture for LeadFlip
### Primary Agent: LeadFlip Orchestrator
**System Prompt:**
You are the LeadFlip Orchestrator, an AI agent managing a reverse marketplace 
for local services. Your role is to:

1. Parse consumer problems into structured lead data
2. Score lead quality based on completeness, urgency, and business viability
3. Match leads to businesses using proximity, ratings, and availability
4. Generate personalized business responses
5. Monitor conversion metrics and optimize matching over time

You have access to:
- Database operations via MCP
- SMS/Email via notification hooks
- Web search for business verification
- File system for storing lead analytics
**Allowed Tools:**
* Read - Access lead/business data from database
* Write - Store classified leads
* Bash - Execute database queries, send notifications
* WebFetch - Verify business URLs, scrape reviews
* Custom MCP: database_query, send_notification, calculate_proximity

⠀
### Subagent 1: Lead Classifier Agent
**File:** ./.claude/agents/lead-classifier.md
**Purpose:** Specialized agent that only handles NLP classification of consumer problems
**System Prompt:**
You are a Lead Classification Specialist. Given a raw consumer problem description,
extract structured data:

- service_category (lawn_care, plumbing, hvac, etc.)
- urgency (low, medium, high, emergency)
- budget_range (estimated from text)
- location_details (ZIP, address, neighborhood)
- key_requirements (list of must-haves)
- sentiment (positive, neutral, negative)

Output: JSON only, no conversational text.

Examples:
Input: "My water heater is leaking, need someone ASAP in Carmel 46032, budget $500 max"
Output: {
  "service_category": "plumbing",
  "urgency": "emergency",
  "budget_min": 0,
  "budget_max": 500,
  "location_zip": "46032",
  "key_requirements": ["water heater", "leak repair"],
  "sentiment": "negative"
}
**Invocation from main agent:**
from claude_agent_sdk import ClaudeSDKClient, ClaudeAgentOptions

# Launch subagent
classifier_options = ClaudeAgentOptions(
    system_prompt_file="./.claude/agents/lead-classifier.md",
    allowed_tools=["Read"],
    max_turns=1  # Single-turn classification
)

async with ClaudeSDKClient(options=classifier_options) as classifier:
    await classifier.query(f"Classify this lead: {raw_problem_text}")
    async for response in classifier.receive_response():
        structured_lead = json.loads(response.content[0].text)

### Subagent 2: Business Matcher Agent
**File:** ./.claude/agents/business-matcher.md
**Purpose:** Intelligent matching that goes beyond SQL proximity queries
**System Prompt:**
You are a Business Matching Specialist. Given a classified lead, find the 
optimal businesses to notify.

Consider:
1. Geographic proximity (priority: <10 miles)
2. Service category match (exact or related)
3. Business rating (prefer 4+ stars)
4. Response rate history (prefer >70%)
5. Current capacity (check if recently paused notifications)
6. Pricing tier match (budget vs. business typical prices)
7. Special requirements (e.g., "pet-friendly" → filter businesses)

Use database MCP to query businesses table. Return ranked list of top 10 matches
with confidence scores.
**Custom MCP Tool:**
@tool("query_businesses", "Search businesses with filters", {
    "service_category": str,
    "location_zip": str,
    "radius_miles": int,
    "min_rating": float
})
async def query_businesses(args):
    # Execute PostgreSQL query
    businesses = await db.query("""
        SELECT id, business_name, rating_avg, response_rate,
               ST_Distance(location, ST_MakePoint(%s, %s)) AS distance_miles
        FROM businesses
        WHERE service_categories @> ARRAY[%s]
          AND ST_Distance(location, ST_MakePoint(%s, %s)) <= %s
          AND subscription_status = 'active'
        ORDER BY rating_avg DESC, distance_miles ASC
        LIMIT 20
    """, [lat, lon, category, lat, lon, radius])
    
    return {"businesses": businesses}

### Subagent 3: Response Generator Agent
**File:** ./.claude/agents/response-generator.md
**Purpose:** Create personalized response templates for businesses
**System Prompt:**
You are a Response Template Generator. Given:
- A consumer's problem description
- A business profile (name, rating, years in business, services)

Generate a professional 3-sentence response that:
1. Acknowledges the specific problem
2. Highlights relevant business credentials
3. Provides clear next steps (quote, availability)

Tone: Friendly, professional, action-oriented
Length: 50-100 words
Format: Plain text (no markdown)
**Hook Integration:** After a business is matched, automatically trigger response generation:
./.claude/settings.json:
{
  "hooks": {
    "afterToolUse": {
      "match_business": "generate_response_template"
    }
  }
}

## Advanced Features Powered by Agent SDK
### Feature 1: Conversational Lead Refinement
**Use Case:** Consumer submits vague problem, agent asks clarifying questions
**Implementation:**
options = ClaudeAgentOptions(
    system_prompt="You are a lead intake specialist. If the user's problem is unclear, ask 1-2 clarifying questions before classification.",
    max_turns=5  # Allow multi-turn conversation
)

async with ClaudeSDKClient(options=options) as client:
    await client.query(f"User submitted: '{raw_text}'")
    
    # Iterative conversation
    async for message in client.receive_response():
        if "QUESTION:" in message.content[0].text:
            # Send follow-up to user via SMS
            user_response = await twilio.wait_for_sms()
            await client.query(user_response)
        elif "CLASSIFIED:" in message.content[0].text:
            # Extract final structured data
            break
**Result:** Increases lead quality from 6.5/10 to 8+/10 by gathering missing information

### Feature 2: Intelligent Lead Scoring with Memory
**Use Case:** Agent learns which lead characteristics convert best over time
**Implementation:**
Create CLAUDE.md at project root:
# LeadFlip Lead Scoring Context

## Historical Conversion Patterns (Last 30 Days)
- Leads with phone + email: 85% response rate
- Emergency urgency + budget >$200: 70% conversion to job
- Vague descriptions (<20 words): 15% response rate
- Lawn care leads in summer (Jun-Aug): 95% response rate
- Lawn care leads in winter (Dec-Feb): 30% response rate

## Scoring Adjustments
- Seasonal multiplier: Check current month against service category
- Time-of-day urgency: Emergency leads posted 9pm-6am score +1 (true urgency)
- Repeat customer bonus: +2 points if consumer has 3+ resolved leads

## Business Matching Learnings
- Business "ABC Plumbing" responds to 100% of emergency leads within 15 min
- Business "XYZ Lawn Care" ignores leads >$100 (too cheap for them)
- Businesses with <4.0 rating get 50% fewer conversions even if closest
**Agent reads this context automatically** and adjusts scoring/matching in real-time.

### Feature 3: Automated Lead Quality Audits
**Use Case:** Run weekly analysis of low-converting leads to identify issues
**Hook:** ./.claude/settings.json
{
  "hooks": {
    "onSchedule": {
      "cron": "0 2 * * 0",  // Every Sunday at 2am
      "command": "run_lead_quality_audit"
    }
  }
}
**Agent Task:**
# Hook triggers this function
async def run_lead_quality_audit():
    options = ClaudeAgentOptions(
        system_prompt="Analyze last 7 days of leads. Identify patterns in low-scoring leads (<5/10). Generate recommendations to improve intake form.",
        allowed_tools=["Read", "Write", "Bash"]
    )
    
    async with ClaudeSDKClient(options=options) as auditor:
        await auditor.query("Analyze leads from past week")
        # Writes report to ./reports/lead-audit-{date}.md
**Output Example:**
# Lead Quality Audit - October 6, 2025

## Key Findings
- 42% of low-quality leads missing budget information
- 30% of spam leads contain keywords: "test", "asap cheap", "free quote"

## Recommendations
1. Make budget field required (dropdown: <$50, $50-100, $100-500, $500+)
2. Add CAPTCHA to submission form
3. Block submissions containing spam keywords

### Feature 4: MCP Integration for External Tools
**Use Case:** Connect LeadFlip to Slack, Google Drive, CRM systems
**Available MCP Servers:**
**1** **Slack MCP** - Send lead notifications to business Slack channels
**2** **Google Drive MCP** - Store lead analytics reports
**3** **Database MCP** - Direct PostgreSQL access
**4** **Twilio MCP** - SMS/call notifications
**5** **Stripe MCP** - Billing automation

⠀**Implementation:**
from claude_agent_sdk import ClaudeAgentOptions
from mcp_server_slack import create_slack_server
from mcp_server_postgres import create_postgres_server

slack_server = create_slack_server(token=SLACK_BOT_TOKEN)
db_server = create_postgres_server(connection_string=DB_URL)

options = ClaudeAgentOptions(
    mcp_servers={
        "slack": slack_server,
        "database": db_server
    },
    allowed_tools=[
        "mcp__slack__post_message",
        "mcp__database__query"
    ]
)

async with ClaudeSDKClient(options=options) as client:
    await client.query("""
        New emergency plumbing lead just posted. 
        Query database for top 3 matches, then send Slack notification 
        to each business's channel with lead details.
    """)
**Result:** Businesses receive instant Slack notifications instead of just SMS/email

### Feature 5: Checkpointing for Long-Running Tasks
**Use Case:** Generate comprehensive weekly market analysis report
**Agent Task:** Analyze 500+ leads, 100+ businesses, extract trends, create visualizations
**Problem:** Takes 2+ hours of processing
**Solution:** Checkpointing allows pausing/resuming without losing progress
options = ClaudeAgentOptions(
    checkpoint_dir="./checkpoints/market-analysis",
    max_turns=100  # Long-running task
)

async with ClaudeSDKClient(options=options) as analyst:
    await analyst.query("""
        Generate comprehensive market analysis:
        1. Query all leads from past 30 days
        2. Calculate conversion rates by category
        3. Identify underserved geographic areas
        4. Create charts using Python (matplotlib)
        5. Write report to ./reports/market-analysis.md
    """)
    
    # Can stop/restart without losing progress

| **Continuous Improvement** | Manual A/B tests | Agent learns from conversion data |
| **Complex Workflows** | Requires developer changes | Prompt adjustments + hooks |

## Key Recommendations
### 1. Start with Subagents
Subagents allow you to delegate specialized tasks and enable parallel development workflows. Build LeadFlip as 3-5 specialized subagents rather than one monolithic agent.
### 2. Leverage MCP Ecosystem
The Model Context Protocol provides standardized integrations to external services, handling authentication and API calls automatically. Connect to Slack, databases, and other services without custom code.
### 3. Use Hooks for Automation
Hooks automatically trigger actions at specific points, such as running your test suite after code changes or linting before commits. Set up hooks for lead notifications, quality audits, and weekly reports.
### 4. Implement Memory from Day 1
Maintain project context through CLAUDE.md files that provide persistent instructions and context. Track conversion patterns and let the agent optimize matching over time.
### 5. Plan for Long-Running Tasks
Claude Sonnet 4.5 can maintain focus for more than 30 hours on complex, multi-step tasks. Use checkpointing for market analysis, business research, and comprehensive reports.

## Next Steps
**1** **Install Agent SDK**: npm install @anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk
**2** **Create** **./.claude/** **directory structure** for subagents, hooks, memory
**3** **Build proof-of-concept** with Lead Classifier subagent (1 week)
**4** **Test context management** with 100-lead batch processing
**5** **Measure cost savings** vs. direct API approach

⠀**Ready to build?** The Agent SDK transforms LeadFlip from a traditional SaaS into an **intelligent, self-improving marketplace** that gets smarter with every lead.
