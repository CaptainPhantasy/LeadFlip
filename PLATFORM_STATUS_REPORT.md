   - Auto-scaling configured
   - ~$5/month for starter tier

2. **Fly.io** (recommended for advanced users)
   - One-command deploy: `flyctl deploy -c fly.websocket.toml`
   - More control over infrastructure
   - ~$3/month for basic tier

**Required Action:**
1. Choose platform (Railway or Fly.io)
2. Run deployment script
3. Copy WebSocket URL to `.env.local`
4. Test connection: `npm run test:websocket`

**Estimated Time:** 30 minutes
**Documentation:** `WEBSOCKET_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md`

### 3. End-to-End Testing Incomplete ⚠️
**Status:** Unit/integration tests exist, E2E tests minimal

**Test Coverage Breakdown:**
- ✅ Authentication: 100% (25 tests passing)
- ✅ Agent orchestration: Framework in place
- ⚠️ Full lead flow: Partially tested
- ❌ AI calling: Not tested (requires WebSocket deployment)
- ❌ Notification delivery: Isolated tests only
- ❌ Business registration: Framework only

**Missing E2E Scenarios:**
- Consumer submits lead → business receives notification
- Business requests AI call → call completes
- Full conversion tracking
- Real SendGrid/SignalWire delivery

**Required Action:**
1. Apply database migration
2. Deploy WebSocket server
3. Run end-to-end test suite
4. Verify real-world flows

**Estimated Time:** 4 hours
