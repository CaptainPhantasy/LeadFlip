## Deliverables

### 1. Docker Configurations ‚úÖ

#### Dockerfile.websocket
- **Purpose**: Container for WebSocket server (Twilio ‚Üî OpenAI Realtime API bridge)
- **Features**:
  - Multi-stage build (optimized for production)
  - Alpine Linux base (minimal attack surface)
  - Non-root user for security
  - Health check endpoint configured
  - Production-ready with proper error handling
- **Build Size**: ~150MB (estimated)
- **Memory**: 512MB recommended minimum

**Key Configuration**:
```dockerfile
FROM node:20-alpine AS base
# ... build stage with TypeScript compilation
FROM node:20-alpine AS production
# ... production stage with only compiled JS
EXPOSE 8080
HEALTHCHECK --interval=30s CMD wget -q --spider http://localhost:8080/health || exit 1
CMD ["node", "dist/server/websocket-server.js"]
```

#### Dockerfile.worker
- **Purpose**: Container for BullMQ call worker (processes call jobs from Redis queue)
- **Features**:
  - Same multi-stage build pattern as WebSocket
  - Process health check (verifies worker is running)
  - Graceful shutdown handling (SIGTERM/SIGINT)
  - Auto-restart on failure (configured in deployment configs)
- **Build Size**: ~140MB (estimated)
- **Memory**: 512MB recommended minimum

**Key Configuration**:

FROM node:20-alpine AS base
# ... build stage
FROM node:20-alpine AS production
# ... production stage
HEALTHCHECK --interval=60s CMD pgrep -f "node dist/server/workers/call-worker.js" || exit 1
CMD ["node", "dist/server/workers/call-worker.js"]
```

- **Features**:
  - Environment variable validation (13+ variables)
  - Service endpoint checks (Next.js, WebSocket, Supabase)
  - External service connectivity (Anthropic, OpenAI, Twilio, Redis)
  - Color-coded output (green=OK, yellow=warning, red=error)
  - Exit codes for CI/CD integration
- **Estimated Run Time**: 30 seconds

**Usage**:
```bash

---

## Cost Analysis

### Infrastructure Costs

**Railway Deployment** (Recommended for MVP):
- WebSocket Server: $5-10/month (512MB, auto-scale 1-3 instances)
- BullMQ Worker: $5-10/month (512MB, auto-scale 1-5 instances)
- **Total**: $10-20/month

**Fly.io Deployment** (Recommended for Production):
- WebSocket Server: $3-8/month (shared CPU, 512MB, 1-3 machines)
- BullMQ Worker: $2-7/month (shared CPU, 512MB, 1-5 machines)
- **Total**: $5-15/month

**Full Stack Costs** (including all services):
- Development/MVP: ~$100/month (see DEPLOYMENT.md for breakdown)
- Production (1,000 users): ~$1,050/month

### Cost Optimization Implemented
- ‚úÖ Multi-stage Docker builds (smaller images = lower storage costs)
- ‚úÖ Alpine Linux base (minimal dependencies)
- ‚úÖ Auto-scaling configured (scale down when idle)
- ‚úÖ Health checks prevent stuck processes consuming resources
- ‚úÖ Graceful shutdown prevents orphaned containers

---

## Security Considerations

### Implemented
- ‚úÖ Non-root user in containers
- ‚úÖ Minimal base image (Alpine Linux)
- ‚úÖ Health check endpoints (no auth required - safe)
- ‚úÖ Environment variables never hardcoded
- ‚úÖ HTTPS enforced via platform (Railway/Fly.io auto-configure)

### Recommended (Not Implemented - User Decision)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Secrets management (Railway/Fly.io built-in is sufficient for MVP)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Network policies (platform handles this)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Container scanning (optional for production)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Rate limiting at infrastructure level (can use Cloudflare)

---

## Known Limitations

### Platform Constraints
1. **Railway Free Tier**: No longer available, must use paid plan ($5/mo minimum)
2. **Fly.io Free Tier**: Limited to 3 shared-CPU VMs (sufficient for development)
3. **Docker Build**: Requires Docker daemon running (user must install Docker Desktop)
4. **Deployment Scripts**: Interactive prompts (not suitable for CI/CD without modification)

### Not Implemented (Out of Scope for Track 5)
- CI/CD pipeline (user can add GitHub Actions later)
- Auto-scaling based on custom metrics (platform defaults sufficient)
- Multi-region deployment (single region US East configured)
- Load balancing (platform handles this)
