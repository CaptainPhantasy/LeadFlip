## Agent Overview

### Main Orchestrator (`main-orchestrator.md`)
**Purpose:** Coordinates entire lead lifecycle from submission to conversion

**Key Responsibilities:**
- Receive consumer leads from API
- Invoke specialized subagents in correct sequence
- Manage database operations via MCP tools
- Send notifications to matched businesses
- Track conversions and update platform memory

**Tools:** Read, Write, Bash, WebFetch, MCP (Database, Twilio, Slack)

**Max Turns:** 20

---

### Lead Classifier (`agents/lead-classifier.md`)
**Purpose:** Transform raw consumer text into structured JSON data

**Input Example:**
```
"My water heater is leaking, need someone ASAP in Carmel 46032, budget $500 max"
```

**Output Example:**
```json
{
  "service_category": "plumbing",
  "urgency": "emergency",
  "budget_min": 0,
  "budget_max": 500,
  "location_zip": "46032",
  "key_requirements": ["water heater", "leak repair"],
  "sentiment": "negative",
  "quality_score": 8.5
}
```

**Tools:** Read (for CLAUDE.md memory access)

**Max Turns:** 1 (single-turn classification for speed)

---

### Business Matcher (`agents/business-matcher.md`)
**Purpose:** Find top 10 businesses most likely to convert a given lead

**Matching Criteria (Weighted):**
1. Geographic proximity (30%) - PostGIS distance calculations
2. Service category match (25%) - Exact or related services
3. Business rating (20%) - 4+ stars prioritized
4. Historical response rate (15%) - >70% preferred
5. Current capacity (10%) - Check if paused or at limit

**Output:** Ranked array with confidence scores 0-1.0

**Tools:** Read, MCP Database (PostGIS queries)

**Max Turns:** 3

---

### Response Generator (`agents/response-generator.md`)
**Purpose:** Create personalized 3-sentence notification messages (50-100 words)

**Message Structure:**
1. **Sentence 1:** Describe the consumer's problem (what & where)
2. **Sentence 2:** Explain why this business is a good match (proximity, specialty, rating)
3. **Sentence 3:** Create urgency with specific response time window

**Example Output:**
```
A homeowner in Carmel (46032) needs emergency water heater repair due to a leak, 
with a budget of up to $500. You're just 2.3 miles away and specialize in water 
heater services, making you an excellent match for this urgent job. Respond within 
15 minutes to secure this lead before competitors.
```

**Tools:** Read (for messaging best practices)

**Max Turns:** 1

---

### Call Agent (`agents/call-agent.md`)
**Purpose:** Orchestrate autonomous AI outbound calls via Twilio + OpenAI Realtime API

**Use Cases:**
1. Business → Consumer (lead qualification)
2. Consumer → Business (callback request)
3. Appointment confirmation

**Responsibilities:**
- Queue call jobs in BullMQ
- Generate conversation system prompts for OpenAI
- Monitor call progress (queued → connecting → in_progress → completed)
- Analyze transcripts and generate structured summaries
- Track costs (Twilio + OpenAI + Claude reasoning)

**Call Outcomes:** goal_achieved, no_answer, voicemail, declined, error

**Tools:** Read, Bash (queue jobs), MCP Database

**Max Turns:** 5

**Note:** This agent orchestrates calls but doesn't handle audio directly (Call Session Worker does that)

---

### Audit Agent (`agents/audit-agent.md`)
**Purpose:** Weekly comprehensive platform performance analysis

**Schedule:** Every Sunday at 2:00 AM (via cron hook)

**Analysis Tasks:**
1. Low-converting lead analysis (identify poor-performing categories)
2. Spam pattern detection (discover new spam keywords/behaviors)
3. Business performance evaluation (top/bottom performers)
4. Intake form improvement recommendations (missing data analysis)
5. Seasonal adjustment validation (verify monthly patterns)

**Output:** Markdown report saved to `./reports/lead-audit-{date}.md`

**Memory Updates:** Appends discovered patterns to CLAUDE.md for all agents to learn from

**Tools:** Read, Write (update CLAUDE.md), MCP Database (analytics queries)

**Max Turns:** 10 (complex analysis with multiple queries)

---

## Agent Invocation Patterns

### Lead Classifier
```typescript
const classifier = new ClaudeSDKClient({
  systemPromptFile: './.claude/agents/lead-classifier.md',
  allowedTools: ['Read'],
  maxTurns: 1
});

await classifier.query(`Classify this lead: ${rawProblemText}`);
```

### Main Orchestrator
```typescript
const orchestrator = new ClaudeSDKClient({
  systemPromptFile: './.claude/main-orchestrator.md',
  allowedTools: ['Read', 'Write', 'Bash', 'WebFetch'],
  mcpServers: { database, twilio, slack },
  maxTurns: 20
});

await orchestrator.query(`New lead submitted: "${rawText}"`);
```

## Key Features

### Single Responsibility Principle
Each subagent does ONE thing exceptionally well:
- Classifier → Structure data
- Matcher → Find businesses
- Generator → Write messages
- Call Agent → Orchestrate calls
- Audit Agent → Analyze & learn

### Context Isolation
Subagents receive minimal context (only what they need), reducing token usage by 50-82% vs. monolithic prompts.

### Memory-Driven Learning
All agents read CLAUDE.md for:
- Seasonal adjustments (lawn care high in summer, low in winter)
- Spam patterns (keywords, behaviors to auto-flag)
- Business performance (who responds fast, who ignores certain leads)
- Conversion patterns (what quality scores convert best)

### Automatic Optimization
Audit Agent discovers patterns weekly → Updates CLAUDE.md → Other agents apply new patterns → Platform gets smarter over time.

## Testing

### Unit Test Example
```typescript
// tests/agents/lead-classifier.test.ts
it('should classify emergency plumbing lead', async () => {
  const classifier = new ClaudeSDKClient({
    systemPromptFile: './.claude/agents/lead-classifier.md',
    maxTurns: 1
  });

  const input = "Water heater leaking, ASAP, Carmel 46032, $500 max";
  await classifier.query(`Classify: ${input}`);

  for await (const response of classifier.receiveResponse()) {
    const result = JSON.parse(response.content[0].text);
    expect(result.service_category).toBe('plumbing');
    expect(result.urgency).toBe('emergency');
    expect(result.quality_score).toBeGreaterThan(7);
  }
});
```

## Cost Optimizations

**Prompt Caching:** System prompts automatically cached by Agent SDK (90% cost reduction on repeated use)

**Context Compaction:** Long sessions automatically compact old context (60-80% savings)

**Subagent Isolation:** Minimal context per agent (50% savings vs. monolithic)

**Expected Total Savings:** 82% cost reduction vs. direct API calls without SDK

## Performance Targets

| Agent              | Target Time | Accuracy Target |
|--------------------|-------------|-----------------|
| Lead Classifier    | <2 seconds  | >95% category   |
| Business Matcher   | <5 seconds  | >85% respond    |
| Response Generator | <2 seconds  | >70% response   |
| Call Agent         | <10 seconds | >70% goal       |
| Main Orchestrator  | <20 seconds | End-to-end      |

## Next Steps

1. **Test Lead Classifier** - Run unit tests with sample leads
2. **Build MCP Servers** - PostgreSQL, Twilio, Slack integrations
3. **Implement Orchestrator** - Wire up subagent coordination
4. **Deploy Call Infrastructure** - BullMQ + WebSocket server
5. **Schedule Audit Agent** - Set up weekly cron job
