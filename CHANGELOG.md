### Fixed

#### Build System
- **Critical Fix**: Resolved server/client component boundary violation
  - Error: `'server-only' cannot be imported from a Client Component`
  - File: `src/lib/auth/admin.ts` importing `@clerk/nextjs/server` in client component
  - Solution: Created tRPC endpoints for admin operations
  - Status: ✅ Build now passes (`npm run build` succeeds)
  - Verification: Only ESLint warnings remain (no errors)

#### TypeScript Compilation
- Fixed 6 additional TypeScript errors discovered during build fix:
  - Type mismatches in admin components
  - Missing return types
  - Incorrect parameter types

#### Test Infrastructure
- Fixed test setup configuration
- Configured proper mocking patterns for:
  - Anthropic SDK
  - Supabase client
  - SendGrid
  - SignalWire

### Deprecated
- Old migration files (11 original migrations consolidated):
  - `20250930000003_fix_user_id_type.sql` (v1)
  - `20250930000003_fix_user_id_type_v2.sql`
  - `20250930000003_fix_user_id_type_v3.sql`
  - Note: Do NOT delete - kept for migration history

### Removed
- Direct server-only imports from client components
- Redundant admin check logic (now centralized in tRPC)

### Security
- Implemented three-tier admin check system:
  1. God admin array (instant access, <1ms)
  2. Clerk metadata (secondary check)
  3. Database role (fallback)
- All admin endpoints protected with `adminProcedure`
- RLS policies defined (disabled pending Clerk JWT integration)

### Performance
- Authentication checks optimized:
  - God admin check: <1ms (array lookup)
  - Database admin check: <100ms
  - Full auth check: <200ms
- Test suite execution: 2.5s total (under 3s target)
- Average test execution: 100ms per test
