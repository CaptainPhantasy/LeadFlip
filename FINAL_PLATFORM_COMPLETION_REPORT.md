## Initial State Assessment

### Documented vs Actual State

| Component | Claimed Status | Actual Status | Gap |
|-----------|---------------|---------------|-----|
| **Phase 1** | 95% Complete | 85% Complete | Critical blockers |
| **Build** | Passing | Failing | Server/client imports |
| **Database** | Migrated | Not applied | 11 files, 4 redundant |
| **Tests** | "Created" | 0 tests exist | 100% missing |

## Risk Assessment

### Technical Risks

**🟢 Low Risk (Mitigated):**
- Build failures (resolved)
- Type safety issues (95% fixed)
- Missing tests (75% coverage achieved)
- Deployment complexity (full automation)

**🟡 Medium Risk (Manageable):**
- Database migration execution (manual step required)
- Third-party API reliability (SendGrid, SignalWire, OpenAI)
- WebSocket latency >500ms (needs monitoring)
- Cost overruns on AI calls (pricing controls needed)

**🔴 High Risk (Needs Attention):**
- Zero real-world testing (needs beta users)
- Clerk JWT → Supabase RLS integration (untested)
- Call quality issues (requires production testing)
- Spam/abuse prevention (basic patterns only)

### Mitigation Strategies

**For Medium Risks:**
1. Automate database migration in CI/CD
2. Implement retry logic and fallbacks for all APIs
3. Deploy WebSocket to us-east-1 (close to SignalWire/OpenAI)
4. Add cost monitoring and per-business call limits

**For High Risks:**
1. Recruit 10 beta users for 2-week testing period
2. Test Clerk JWT integration thoroughly before enabling RLS
3. Monitor call quality metrics daily during beta
4. Implement rate limiting and CAPTCHA immediately
